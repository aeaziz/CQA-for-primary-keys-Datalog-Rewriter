# CQA for primary keys Datalog Rewriter
## Introduction
This is a python script that generates a Datalog program for the problem know in the litterature as CQA.
By default, it takes as input a file containing a sjfBCQ query and writes the output program in a file named "output.txt", but the main.py file can be easily modified to change this behavior.

## What is a CQA Problem?
CQA for primary keys is the following problem:

Given a database db that may violate its primary-key constraints, multiple reparations can be generated by deleting a minimal set of tuples from db. 
For every sjfCBQ q, CERTAINTY(q) is the problem that takes as input db and asks whether q evaluates true for every reparation of db.

This scripts impliments CERTAINTY(q) in a Datalog program.
## Usage
The main script takes as input a sjfBCQ using a specific syntax.
The syntax is essentially the same than Datalog queries, but extending it with key-values being surrounded by [ ]

Example : R([X],Y),S([Y],X) is a valid query.
