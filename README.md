# CQA for primary keys Datalog Rewriter
## Introduction
This is a python script that generates a Datalog program for the problem know in the litterature as CQA.
By default, it takes as input a file containing a sjfBCQ query and writes the output program in a file named "output.txt", but the main.py file can be easily modified to change this behavior.

## What is a CQA Problem?
**CQA** for primary keys is the following problem:

Given a database **db** that may violate its primary-key constraints, multiple reparations can be generated by deleting a minimal set of tuples from **db**. 
For every sjfCBQ **q**, **CERTAINTY(q)** is the problem that takes as input **db** and asks whether **q** evaluates true for every reparation of **db**.

This scripts impliments **CERTAINTY(q)** in a **Datalog** program.
## Usage
The main script takes as input a sjfBCQ using a specific syntax.
The syntax is essentially the same than Datalog queries, but extending it with key-values being surrounded by [ ]

Example : R([X],Y),S([Y],X) is a valid query.
## How does it work?
The articles in the References section talk about how the complexity of **CERTAINTY(q)** can be determined. 
This code generates all the necessary tools (Attack Graph) to find the complexity of **CERTAINTY(q)**.
As it is specified in the articles, there're 3 cases:
* **CERTAINTY(Q)** is in **FO**
* **CERTAINTY(Q)** is in **L**
* **CERTAINTY(Q)** is in **Co-NPHard**
For the 2 first cases, a Datalog rewrite is possible. The third case can be detected but a rewriting is not possible.
